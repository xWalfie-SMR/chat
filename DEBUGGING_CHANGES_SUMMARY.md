- Shows counts for all user categories

### 7. Server Startup - Lines 1375-1393
**Purpose:** Initialize server
**Changes:**
- Created informative startup banner
- Lists grace period configuration
- Documents all debug log prefixes
- Shows purpose of grace period feature

## Debug Log Prefixes Added

| Prefix | When It Appears | Key Information |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| `[GRACE START]` | User disconnects | Username, device ID, timestamps, duration |
| `[GRACE CANCELLED]` | User reconnects in time | Time in grace, remaining time, success % |
| `[GRACE EXPIRED]` | Grace timeout fires | Duration, state verification, cleanup |
| `[QUICK RECONNECT SUCCESS]` | Auth within grace | Username restored, seamless reconnect |
| `[RECONNECT AFTER GRACE]` | Auth after grace expired | Username restored, will announce join |
| `[IMMEDIATE CLEANUP]` | Forced cleanup | Reason, grace cancellation if pending |
| `[AUTH]` / `[AUTH CHECK 1-3]` | User authentication | Full auth flow, reconnection detection |
| `[DISCONNECT]` / `[DISCONNECT ERROR]` | Connection closes | User info, authentication status |
| `[ADMIN STATS]` | Stats requested | Grace users with timing details |
| `[GRACE DEBUG]` | Various validations | Edge cases and state verification |

## New Documentation

### GRACE_PERIOD_DEBUGGING.md
Comprehensive documentation including:
- Overview of grace period functionality
- Detailed explanation of each log prefix
- Example log outputs
- Monitoring success metrics
- Troubleshooting guide
- Testing recommendations
- Performance considerations

## Benefits

1. **Visibility**: Complete visibility into grace period lifecycle
2. **Troubleshooting**: Easy to diagnose reconnection issues
3. **Monitoring**: Track success rates and timing metrics
4. **Testing**: Verify correct behavior with detailed logs
5. **Performance**: Understand grace period utilization

## Testing

The changes have been validated:
- ✓ Syntax check passed
- ✓ Server starts successfully with new banner
- ✓ All existing functionality preserved
- ✓ No breaking changes introduced

## Example Log Flow (Quick Reconnect)

```
[DISCONNECT] WebSocket closed
  Username: alice
  DeviceId: device-123
[GRACE START] User disconnected - starting grace period
  Username: alice
  DeviceId: device-123
  Grace period: 10s
  ...
[AUTH] Processing authentication request
  DeviceId: device-123
  Has grace period: true
[AUTH CHECK 1] Checking for quick reconnect...
[GRACE CANCELLED] User reconnected within grace period
  Time in grace period: 2.50s
  Success rate: 25.0% of grace period used
[QUICK RECONNECT SUCCESS] alice (device-123) reconnected within grace period
  Will NOT announce join (seamless reconnect)
[AUTH COMPLETE] alice authenticated successfully
```

## Usage

Simply run the server and monitor logs. No configuration needed. All grace period operations are automatically logged with detailed context.
