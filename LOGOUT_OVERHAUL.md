# Logout Functionality Overhaul

## Summary

The logout functionality has been completely overhauled to properly handle user disconnections, state cleanup, and re-authentication. This addresses issues where logout didn't work correctly and users experienced race conditions or stuck states.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Side Changes (`server.js`)

#### New Logout Message Handler
Added a new `logout` message type handler that:
- Validates user authentication before allowing logout
- Performs immediate cleanup (no grace period for explicit logouts)
- Broadcasts departure message to other users
- Sends confirmation back to client before closing connection
- Properly cleans up all user state (username, deviceId, rate limits)

```javascript
if (data.type === "logout") {
  // Immediate cleanup - no grace period for explicit logout
  const cleanupData = immediateCleanup(ws);
  sendToClient(ws, "loggedOut", {});
  if (cleanupData && cleanupData.username) {
    broadcast(`[${cleanupData.username}] ha salido del chat.`);
  }
  ws.close();
  return;
}
```

**Key Behavior:**
- Explicit logouts use `immediateCleanup()` instead of `scheduleCleanup()`
- This means no 10-second grace period - immediate username availability
- Other users are immediately notified of the departure

### 2. Client-Side Changes (`docs/index.html`)

#### Improved Logout Flow
The logout confirmation handler now:
1. Sets `isLoggingOut` flag to prevent auto-reconnect
2. Clears any pending reconnect timers
3. **Sends logout message to server** (new!)
4. Waits 100ms for server processing
5. Closes WebSocket connection
6. Clears all local state and UI
7. Shows username prompt for re-login
8. Resets flags without immediately reconnecting

```javascript
logoutConfirm.addEventListener("click", () => {
  logoutPrompt.classList.add("hidden");
  isLoggingOut = true;
  
  // Send logout message to server before closing
  if (ws && ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "logout" }));
  }
  
  // Wait for server to process, then clean up
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Close connection and clear all state
    // ...
  }, 100);
});
```

#### New Message Handler
Added handler for `loggedOut` confirmation message from server.

### 3. End-to-End Tests

Added comprehensive test suite in `test/` directory:

#### `test/logout.test.js` - Unit-style E2E Tests
- ✓ Basic logout and state cleanup
- ✓ Re-login with same username after logout
- ✓ Logout requires authentication
- ✓ Multiple users can logout independently

#### `test/server-logout.test.js` - Integration Tests
- ✓ Full authentication → logout → re-authentication cycle
- ✓ Departure broadcast to other users

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
npm run test:logout  # Logout tests only
```

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Race Condition on Logout
**Problem:** Client immediately called `connect()` after `ws.close()`, causing async race conditions.

**Solution:** Removed immediate reconnection. Client now waits for connection to fully close and only shows username prompt.

### 2. Grace Period on Explicit Logout
**Problem:** Server used 10-second grace period even for explicit logouts, keeping username reserved.

**Solution:** Added separate `immediateCleanup()` path for explicit logouts, making username immediately available.

### 3. No Server Notification
**Problem:** Server wasn't informed of explicit logouts, treating them like network disconnections.

**Solution:** Client now sends `{ type: "logout" }` message before closing connection.

### 4. Incomplete State Cleanup
**Problem:** Some state wasn't properly cleared on logout (reconnect timers, flags).

**Solution:** Comprehensive cleanup of all state, timers, and flags in proper order.

### 5. Silent Logout
**Problem:** Other users weren't notified when someone logged out.

**Solution:** Server broadcasts departure message immediately on explicit logout.

## Behavior Comparison

### Before
1. User clicks logout
2. Connection closes immediately
3. 10-second grace period starts
4. Username stays reserved for 10 seconds
5. Other users see departure after 10 seconds
6. Auto-reconnect attempts might trigger

### After
1. User clicks logout
2. Logout message sent to server
3. Server confirms with `loggedOut` message
4. **Immediate** cleanup (no grace period)
5. Username available immediately
6. Other users notified immediately
7. Connection closes cleanly
8. No auto-reconnect attempts

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:

```
Logout E2E Tests
  ✔ should properly logout and clean up user state
  ✔ should allow re-login after logout with same username
  ✔ should not allow logout without authentication
  ✔ should handle multiple users logging out independently

Server Logout Integration Tests
  ✔ should connect, authenticate, logout, and re-authenticate successfully
  ✔ should broadcast user departure after explicit logout

6 passing (3s)
```

## Protocol Documentation

### Logout Message (Client → Server)
```json
{
  "type": "logout"
}
```

Requirements:
- Must be authenticated
- Connection must be open

### Logout Confirmation (Server → Client)
```json
{
  "type": "loggedOut"
}
```

Sent immediately before server closes the connection.

### Departure Broadcast (Server → All Other Clients)
```json
{
  "type": "chat",
  "msg": "[username] ha salido del chat.",
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

The changes are **fully backward compatible**:
- Existing connections without logout message still work
- Grace period cleanup still applies to network disconnections
- All existing message types unchanged
- Terminal client unaffected (uses text mode, not JSON)

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
1. Add "logout all devices" functionality
2. Track logout timestamp in server logs for analytics
3. Add configurable logout timeout (currently 100ms)
4. Persist logout events for audit trail
5. Add UI feedback during logout process

## Developer Notes

- The `isLoggingOut` flag prevents auto-reconnect during logout
- 100ms delay ensures server processes logout before connection closes
- `immediateCleanup()` is reused for both logout and kicked users
- Tests use dynamic ports to avoid conflicts with running servers
