# Logout Overhaul - Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

The logout functionality has been completely overhauled and is now working perfectly. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. Fixed Server-Side Logout (server.js)
- ✅ Added proper `logout` message handler
- ✅ Immediate cleanup for explicit logouts (no 10-second grace period)
- ✅ Broadcasts departure message to other users
- ✅ Sends confirmation before closing connection

### 2. Fixed Client-Side Logout (docs/index.html)
- ✅ Sends `logout` message to server before disconnecting
- ✅ Waits for server to process before closing connection
- ✅ Clears all state (localStorage, UI, flags)
- ✅ No more race conditions or auto-reconnect issues
- ✅ Shows username prompt for clean re-login

### 3. Comprehensive E2E Tests
- ✅ 6 automated tests covering all scenarios
- ✅ Unit-style tests with mock server
- ✅ Integration tests with real server
- ✅ 100% test pass rate

## 🎯 How It Works Now

**User Experience:**
1. User clicks settings (⚙️) → "Cerrar sesión"
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms
4. Logout happens instantly
5. Username immediately available for reuse
6. Other users see departure message
7. User can log back in right away

**Technical Flow:**
1. Client sends `{ type: "logout" }` to server
2. Server does immediate cleanup
3. Server broadcasts "[username] ha salido del chat"
4. Server sends `{ type: "loggedOut" }` confirmation
5. Connection closes cleanly
6. Client clears all local state
7. Username prompt shown

## 📊 Test Results

All 6 tests passing:

```
✔ should properly logout and clean up user state
✔ should allow re-login after logout with same username
✔ should not allow logout without authentication
✔ should handle multiple users logging out independently
✔ should connect, authenticate, logout, and re-authenticate successfully
✔ should broadcast user departure after explicit logout

6 passing (3s)
```

## 🚀 How to Verify

**Run Tests:**
```bash
npm test
```

**Manual Test:**
1. Start server: `npm start`
2. Open web client in browser (or open the hosted URL)
3. Login with any username
4. Click settings gear icon (⚙️)
5. Click "Cerrar sesión"
6. Confirm logout
7. ✅ You should be logged out and see username prompt
8. ✅ You can login again immediately
9. ✅ Same username is available

## 📁 Files Modified

**Core Files:**
- `server.js` - Added logout handler with immediate cleanup
- `docs/index.html` - Overhauled logout flow
- `package.json` - Added test scripts

**New Files:**
