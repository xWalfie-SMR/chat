# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed - Logout Functionality Overhaul

#### What Was Broken
- Logout didn't properly disconnect users from the server
- Race conditions when reconnecting after logout
- Username stayed reserved for 10 seconds after logout (grace period)
- Other users weren't notified of logout
- Client state wasn't fully cleared on logout

#### What Was Fixed

**Server-Side (server.js)**
- ✅ Added new `logout` message type handler
- ✅ Explicit logouts now use immediate cleanup (no grace period)
- ✅ Server broadcasts departure message to other users
- ✅ Sends `loggedOut` confirmation before closing connection
- ✅ Properly removes user from all state tracking immediately

**Client-Side (docs/index.html)**
- ✅ Logout now sends proper `logout` message to server
- ✅ Fixed race condition by removing immediate reconnect
- ✅ Added proper state cleanup (localStorage, UI, flags)
- ✅ Added 100ms delay to ensure server processes logout
- ✅ Added handler for `loggedOut` confirmation message

**Testing**
- ✅ Added comprehensive E2E test suite using Mocha + Chai
- ✅ 6 automated tests covering all logout scenarios
- ✅ Integration tests with actual server process
- ✅ All tests passing (100% success rate)

#### Test Results
```
Logout E2E Tests
  ✔ should properly logout and clean up user state
  ✔ should allow re-login after logout with same username
  ✔ should not allow logout without authentication
  ✔ should handle multiple users logging out independently

Server Logout Integration Tests
  ✔ should connect, authenticate, logout, and re-authenticate successfully
  ✔ should broadcast user departure after explicit logout

6 passing (3s)
```

#### Files Changed
- `server.js` - Added logout message handler with immediate cleanup
- `docs/index.html` - Overhauled logout flow with proper server communication
- `package.json` - Added test scripts and dev dependencies (mocha, chai)
- `test/logout.test.js` - Unit-style E2E tests
- `test/server-logout.test.js` - Integration tests
- `test/README.md` - Test documentation
- `LOGOUT_OVERHAUL.md` - Comprehensive documentation of changes

#### New Commands
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:logout   # Run only logout tests
```

#### Backward Compatibility
✅ All changes are backward compatible
- Existing connections work without changes
- Network disconnections still use grace period
- All existing message types unchanged
- Terminal client unaffected

#### How to Verify
1. Run the test suite: `npm test`
2. Start the server: `npm start`
3. Open the web client in a browser
4. Login with a username
5. Click settings (⚙️) → "Cerrar sesión"
6. Confirm logout
7. Verify you're logged out and can log back in immediately

The logout now works perfectly! 🎉
